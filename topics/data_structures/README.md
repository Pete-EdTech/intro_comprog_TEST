# Data Structures

Data structures are foundational concepts in programming, essential for storing, organizing, and managing data efficiently. In this module, "Data Structures," you'll explore various ways to store and interact with data in your programs. We'll delve into arrays and lists for sequential data storage, strings for text manipulation, dictionaries (or maps) for storing key-value pairs, and sets and tuples for unique and immutable collections. Understanding these data structures will enhance your ability to solve complex problems by providing the tools needed to handle data in a structured and efficient manner.

## Topics Covered:

1. **[Arrays and Lists](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/data_structures/topics/arrays_lists)**
   - Understand the concept of sequential storage.
   - Learn how to create, access, and manipulate elements in arrays (fixed-size) and lists (dynamic-size).

2. **[Strings and String Operations](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/data_structures/topics/strings_operations)**
   - Explore how strings are used to store and manipulate textual data.
   - Learn common string operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

3. **[Dictionaries or Maps (Key-Value Pairs)](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/data_structures/topics/dictionaries_maps)**
   - Understand how dictionaries/maps store data as key-value pairs.
   - Learn how to add, retrieve, and remove items, and explore use-cases for when dictionaries/maps are the optimal choice.

4. **[Sets and Tuples](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/data_structures/topics/sets_tuples)**
   - Get to know sets as collections of unique elements.
   - Understand tuples as immutable sequences, and learn when and why to use them in your programs.
