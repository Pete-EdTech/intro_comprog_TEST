## Control Structures

In programming, control structures are fundamental constructs that dictate the flow of your program's execution. They enable your program to make decisions (conditional statements) and perform repetitive tasks (loops), thereby adding logic and depth to your code. This module, "Control Structures," will guide you through the intricacies of controlling the flow of your program using conditional statements and loops, and will introduce you to the `break` and `continue` statements for advanced loop control. Mastering these concepts will empower you to write more efficient, effective, and dynamic code.

### Topics Covered:

1. **[Conditional Statements](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/control_structures/topics/conditional_statements)**
   - **If, Else, and Elif:** Learn how to execute code based on certain conditions. Understand how to branch your code into different paths based on logical conditions.
   - **Switch/Case Statements (language-specific):** Explore how some languages offer switch-case structures as a more efficient way to handle multiple conditions.

2. **[Loops](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/control_structures/topics/loops)**
   - **For Loops:** Understand how to use for loops to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or range of numbers.
   - **While Loops:** Learn how to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. Delve into the concept of infinite loops and how to avoid them.
   - **Do-While Loops (language-specific):** Get to know this variant of the while loop where the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.

3. **[Break and Continue Statements](https://github.com/PeteComSci/intro_comprog/tree/main/topics/control_structures/topics/break_continue)**
   - **Break Statement:** Discover how to immediately exit a loop, regardless of the condition, effectively interrupting the cycle.
   - **Continue Statement:** Learn how to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration, allowing for more nuanced loop control.

By the end of this module, you will be proficient in using control structures to direct your program's flow, making your coding practice more refined and your programs more sophisticated and robust.
