# Lists

Lists in Python are like your own collection of favorite things. They can be changed, updated, and modified as you like.

### Crafting Your First List

Creating a list is like packing your backpack - you decide what goes in and what stays out.

Example:
```python
favorite_subjects = ['Math', 'Science', 'History', 'Art']
print(favorite_subjects)
```

### Accessing Elements in Your List

Grabbing an item from your list is as easy as picking a book from your shelf. Just remember, we start counting from 0.

Example:
```python
print(favorite_subjects[0]) # Outputs 'Math'
message = f"My favorite subject is {favorite_subjects[2]}."
print(message) # Outputs 'My favorite subject is History.'
```

### Tweaking Your List (Multiple Means of Action & Expression)

Feel free to rearrange your list, add new interests, or remove what's no longer a favorite.

#### Modifying Elements

Changing an item in your list is like updating your playlist with new songs.

Example:
```python
favorite_subjects[3] = 'Physical Education'
print(favorite_subjects)
```

#### Expanding Your List

Discover a new hobby? Add it to your list using `append()` or `insert()`.

Example:
```python
favorite_subjects.append('Computer Science')
favorite_subjects.insert(2, 'English Literature')
print(favorite_subjects)
```

#### Streamlining Your List

Sometimes we outgrow our interests. Remove items easily with `del` or `remove()`.

Example:
```python
del favorite_subjects[1] # Bye Science
favorite_subjects.remove('Math') # See ya Math
print(favorite_subjects)
```

## Exercises

Apply your skills in a way that works best for you. Choose an exercise, try it out, and feel free to express your solution in a way that showcases your unique understanding.

### Exercise 1: Dream Devices (Multiple Means of Representation)

Make a list of the tech gadgets you dream about. Write code that expresses why you want each item. 
For advanced students: feel free to include images, links to articles, or even videos about these gadgets to make your reasoning richer and more diverse.

### Exercise 2: Top Movies Invite (Multiple Means of Engagement)

Hosting a movie marathon? List your top 3 movies and invite friends creatively. Maybe write a fun email, create a digital invitation, or even record a video invite!

### Exercise 3: Global Explorer (Multiple Means of Action & Expression)

Dreaming of traveling? List your top 5 destinations. Then, organize your list in creative ways. Perhaps create a map with pins for each location or a collage of images representing each place.
