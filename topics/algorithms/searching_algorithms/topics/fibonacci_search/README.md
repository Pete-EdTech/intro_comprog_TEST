# Fibonacci Search

Fibonacci Search is a search algorithm that efficiently locates an element in a sorted array by dividing the search interval in a unique way. It uses Fibonacci numbers, which leads to a division of the array into uneven parts, making it particularly advantageous for specific types of data distributions. Let's explore Fibonacci Search in the context of a real-world application that students can relate to easily.

### Real-World Context: Efficient File Searching

Let's consider a scenario where Fibonacci Search is used for efficiently locating a specific page in a large digital file or document, where the pages are sorted based on some criteria (like dates, headings, or numerical order).

#### Scenario Description:
Imagine you're using an e-reader with thousands of pages and you want to quickly navigate to a section of the book. The e-reader has a feature that allows you to jump pages based on Fibonacci numbers, optimizing the search process when you're trying to find a specific section or chapter.

In this scenario, the e-reader's software uses Fibonacci Search to minimize the number of page loads, which can be time-consuming, especially in very large documents. By using Fibonacci numbers to determine where to "jump" next in the document, the software efficiently narrows down the range of pages, speeding up the search for the desired section.

This application of Fibonacci Search in digital document navigation provides a real-world context that students can easily understand and relate to, illustrating how algorithms can be used to enhance user experience and system performance in everyday technology.

In this context, Fibonacci Search allows the e-reader to quickly reduce the range of pages to be searched, making the process of finding a specific page much faster than sequentially going through each page or even using regular binary search. This application underscores the relevance and utility of learning and understanding search algorithms, as they directly contribute to the efficiency of common digital tools and platforms.

<summary>Example: Fibonacci Search in Digital Document Navigation</summary>

Imagine you're using an e-reader with a large digital document or book, and you want to quickly navigate to a specific section or page. The e-reader's software uses Fibonacci Search to optimize the page loading process, especially useful for very large documents.

Here's how Fibonacci Search works in this context:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The digital document is organized in a way that the pages are sorted (e.g., by date, headings, or numerical order).
   - You have a specific section or page number you want to find.

2. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers:**
   - The software generates Fibonacci numbers until it gets the smallest Fibonacci number that is greater than or equal to the number of pages in the document.

3. **Search with Fibonacci Numbers:**
   - The software uses Fibonacci numbers to set two markers or indices in the document, dividing it into uneven parts.
   - It compares the content at these markers with your target section or page.

4. **Adjust and Repeat:**
   - Based on the comparison, the software adjusts the markers, narrowing down the range of pages where your target could be.
   - This process continues, leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to quickly reduce the search range.

In this scenario, Fibonacci Search helps the software in the e-reader quickly find the specific section you're looking for, minimizing the page loads and making the navigation process much faster and more efficient.

<summary>Trace Table for Digital Document Navigation</summary>
A trace table can illustrate how the Fibonacci Search algorithm operates in the context of digital document navigation.

Given a digital document with pages sorted and a target section:

| Step | Markers (Fibonacci Indices) | Action                               | Description                                                        |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | F(k), F(k-1)                | Place markers at Fibonacci indices   | Divide the document into sections based on Fibonacci numbers.      |
| 2    | Compare content at markers  | Check if the content matches target  | Determine if the target is before, after, or at the current marker.|
| 3    | Adjust markers              | Move markers based on comparison     | Narrow down the range by adjusting markers to new Fibonacci indices.|
| 4    | Repeat steps 1-3            | Continue until target is found       | Iteratively apply Fibonacci Search to find the specific section.   |

This table demonstrates how Fibonacci Search strategically reduces the search range, using the properties of Fibonacci numbers for efficient navigation within a digital document.

### Pseudocode Example: Fibonacci Search for Digital Document Navigation

```plaintext
// Pseudocode: Fibonacci Search for navigating a digital document

// Array representing the pages or sections of the document
Set documentSections to array of sections [...]

// The section or page number we are searching for
Set targetSection to ...

// Generate the largest Fibonacci number smaller than the length of documentSections
Set fibM to the largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of documentSections
Set fibM_minus_1 to the second largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of documentSections
Set fibM_minus_2 to the third largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of documentSections

// Define the offset
Set offset to -1

// While there are elements to be inspected
While fibM > 1 Do
    // Check if fibM_minus_2 is a valid location
    Set i to minimum(offset + fibM_minus_2, length of documentSections - 1)

    // Compare section at index i with the target section
    If documentSections[i] < targetSection Then
        // Move one Fibonacci down
        Set fibM to fibM_minus_1
        Set fibM_minus_1 to fibM_minus_2
        Set fibM_minus_2 to fibM - fibM_minus_1
        Set offset to i
    Else If documentSections[i] > targetSection Then
        // Move two Fibonacci down
        Set fibM to fibM_minus_2
        Set fibM_minus_1 to fibM_minus_1 - fibM_minus_2
        Set fibM_minus_2 to fibM - fibM_minus_1
    Else
        // Section found
        Output "Section found at position: ", i
        Exit
    End If
End While

// Checking the last element
If fibM_minus_1 and documentSections[offset+1] equals targetSection Then
    Output "Section found at position: ", offset+1
Else
    // Section not found
    Output "Section not found."
```

In this pseudocode:
- Fibonacci numbers are used to set the range of elements to be inspected.
- The range is adjusted based on the comparison of the target section with the sections at specific Fibonacci positions.
- The process is repeated until the section is found or the range is empty.

### Python Example: Fibonacci Search for Digital Document Navigation

```python
# Python: Fibonacci Search for navigating a digital document

# Array representing the pages or sections of the document
document_sections = [...]

# The section or page number we are searching for
target_section = ...

# Generate the largest Fibonacci number smaller than the length of document_sections
fibM = largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of document_sections
fibM_minus_1 = second largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of document_sections
fibM_minus_2 = third largest Fibonacci number smaller than length of document_sections

# Define the offset
offset = -1

# While there are elements to be inspected
while fibM > 1:
    # Check if fibM_minus_2 is a valid location
    i = min(offset + fibM_minus_2, len(document_sections) - 1)

    # Compare section at index i with the target section
    if document_sections[i] < target_section:
        # Move one Fibonacci down
        fibM = fibM_minus_1
        fibM_minus_1 = fibM_minus_2
        fibM_minus_2 = fibM -

 fibM_minus_1
        offset = i
    elif document_sections[i] > target_section:
        # Move two Fibonacci down
        fibM = fibM_minus_2
        fibM_minus_1 = fibM_minus_1 - fibM_minus_2
        fibM_minus_2 = fibM - fibM_minus_1
    else:
        # Section found
        print(f"Section found at position: {i}")
        break

# Checking the last element
if fibM_minus_1 and document_sections[offset+1] == target_section:
    print(f"Section found at position: {offset+1}")
else:
    # Section not found
    print("Section not found.")
```

In this Python code:
- We use the same logic as in the pseudocode to find the position of the target section using Fibonacci numbers.
- The range is adjusted based on the comparison of the target section with the sections at specific Fibonacci positions.
- The process repeats, narrowing down the range until we find the target section.

This context and implementation of Fibonacci Search demonstrate how algorithms can be effectively applied in digital systems for efficient data retrieval, enhancing user experience and system performance in technologies that are integral to our daily lives.
