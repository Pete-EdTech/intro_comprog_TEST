# Defining and Calling Functions

Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming. They allow you to encapsulate code so it can be reused and organized. Here we'll dive into how to define and call functions in both pseudocode and Python, with detailed explanations to ensure clarity and immediate relatability for students.

### Practical Example: Calculating the Average Grade

Imagine you're writing a program to calculate the average grade for students in a class. This operation is something you'll likely need to do multiple times, so it's a perfect candidate for a function.

#### Pseudocode Example: Defining and Calling a Function

```plaintext

// Define a function to calculate the average grade
function CALCULATEAVERAGE(GRADES)
    // Initialize total to 0
    set TOTAL to 0
    
    // Add up all the grades
    for each GRADE in GRADES do
        set TOTAL to TOTAL + GRADE
    end for
    
    // Calculate the average
    set AVERAGE to TOTAL / length of GRADES
    
    // Return the result
    return AVERAGE
end function

// Main program
set GRADES to [85, 92, 78, 90, 89]
set AVERAGEGRADE to CALCULATEAVERAGE(GRADES)

// Output the result
output "The average grade is: ", AVERAGEGRADE

```

**In this pseudocode:**
- The function `calculateAverage` is defined to calculate the average of a list of grades.
- Inside the function, we iterate over the list of grades, add them up, and then divide by the number of grades to find the average.
- The function returns the average, which is then printed in the main program.

#### Python Example: Defining and Calling a Function

```python
# Define a function to calculate the average grade
def calculate_average(grades):
    total = sum(grades)  # Sums up all the grades
    average = total / len(grades)  # Calculates the average
    return average  # Returns the average grade

# Main program
grades = [85, 92, 78, 90, 89]
average_grade = calculate_average(grades)  # Calls the function with the list of grades

print(f"The average grade is: {average_grade}")
```

**In this Python code:**
- The function `calculate_average` is defined with `def` followed by the function name and parameters.
- The function uses built-in Python functions `sum()` and `len()` to calculate the total and find the number of grades, respectively.
- The function returns the calculated average, which is then printed in the main program.

<summary>Real-Life Example: Organizing a School Event</summary>

Imagine you're part of the school's event organizing committee. Your task is to coordinate various aspects of multiple events throughout the year, like the annual sports meet, the science fair, and the cultural fest. Each event requires careful planning of several components such as sending invitations, arranging food, and setting up the venue. 

This is where functions in programming come into play, similar to having a checklist or a set of instructions for each component of the event. Just like you might have a standard procedure for sending out invitations (like creating the invite, listing the guests, and then mailing them), you can write a function for each task in your program.

#### Pseudocode Example: Organizing a School Event

```plaintext
// Define a function to send invitations
Function sendInvitations(guestList, eventName)
    For each guest in guestList Do
        Create invitation for eventName
        Send invitation to guest
    End For
    Output "Invitations sent for ", eventName
End Function

// Define a function to arrange food
Function arrangeFood(menu, eventName)
    For each item in menu Do
        Order item for eventName
    End For
    Output "Food arranged for ", eventName
End Function

// Main program for the Annual Sports Meet
Set guestList to ["Parent1", "Parent2", "Mayor"]
Set eventName to "Annual Sports Meet"
Set menu to ["Water", "Snacks", "Lunch"]

sendInvitations(guestList, eventName)  // Call function to send invitations
arrangeFood(menu, eventName)  // Call function to arrange food

Output "Preparations complete for ", eventName
```

**In this pseudocode:**
- Functions `sendInvitations` and `arrangeFood` are defined to handle specific tasks related to the event.
- Each function takes parameters relevant to the task (like `guestList` and `eventName` for sending invitations).
- These functions are called in the main program with specific arguments for the "Annual Sports Meet" event.

#### Python Example: Organizing a School Event

```python
# Define a function to send invitations
def send_invitations(guest_list, event_name):
    for guest in guest_list:
        # Assume function create_and_send_invitation() does the job
        create_and_send_invitation(guest, event_name)
    print(f"Invitations sent for {event_name}")

# Define a function to arrange food
def arrange_food(menu, event_name):
    for item in menu:
        # Assume function order_food_item() does the job
        order_food_item(item, event_name)
    print(f"Food arranged for {event_name}")

# Main program for the Annual Sports Meet
guest_list = ["Parent1", "Parent2", "Mayor"]
event_name = "Annual Sports Meet"
menu = ["Water", "Snacks", "Lunch"]

send_invitations(guest_list, event_name)  # Call function to send invitations
arrange_food(menu, event_name)  # Call function to arrange food

print(f"Preparations complete for {event_name}")
```

**In this Python code:**
- Functions `send_invitations` and `arrange_food` are created to manage event preparations.
- These functions are used to encapsulate and organize tasks, making the main program clean and easy to understand.
- By calling these functions with specific arguments, the tasks for the "Annual Sports Meet" are executed efficiently.

In this example, functions are like your personal assistants, each responsible for a specific task in organizing the school event. Just as in real-life where having a systematic approach to organizing events can save time and prevent errors, in programming, defining and calling functions makes your code more efficient, modular, and maintainable.

Through these examples, you learn how to encapsulate code within functions, making their programs more modular, reusable, and organized. Functions are powerful tools in programming, promoting code reuse and making complex programs easier to manage and understand.

<summary>Exercise 1: Understanding Functions</summary>

**Objective:** Write a function in Python.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a Python function named `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle.
2. The function should take two parameters: `length` and `width`.
3. It should return the calculated area.
4. Call the function with different values for `length` and `width` and print the results.

**Questions to Ponder:**
- What happens if you input negative numbers?
- How might you modify the function to handle incorrect input?

1. Create a Python file named `math_operations.py`.
2. In `math_operations.py`, define two functions: `add(a, b)` and `multiply(a, b)`.
3. In your main program file, import `math_operations` module.
4. Use the `add` and `multiply` functions from the `math_operations` module to perform calculations and print the results.

<summary>Group Activity: Function Creation Relay</summary>

**Objective:** Collaborate to write a complex program using functions.

**Instructions:**
1. Divide the class into small groups.
2. Assign each group the task of writing one function for a larger program. For example, for a calculator program, one group could write a function for addition, another for subtraction, etc.
3. Each group should write documentation for their function explaining what it does, its parameters, and its return value.
4. Combine all the functions into one program and demonstrate how they work together.

**Questions to Ponder:**
- How did dividing the work into functions help organize the overall program?
