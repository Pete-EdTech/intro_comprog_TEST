# Version Control Systems

Version control systems are essential tools in the world of software development, enabling multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. They allow you to track changes, revert to previous stages, and efficiently collaborate with others. In this module, we'll focus on Git, one of the most widely used version control systems.

Git helps manage the evolution of a set of files – often source code for a software application – by keeping track of changes and enabling team collaboration. Understanding how to use Git is crucial for backing up your work, collaborating with others, and contributing to open-source projects.
