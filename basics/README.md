## Basics of a Programming Language

This module is all about understanding the grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure of programming languages. Just like learning a new spoken language, you'll start with the basicsâ€”syntax, variables, operators, and how to communicate input and output. These foundational concepts are crucial for writing any program and will serve as the building blocks for your coding journey.

### Topics Covered:

1. **Syntax and Structure**
   - Learn the rules that define the structure of a program.
   - Understand how proper syntax is crucial for the program to be correctly understood and executed by the computer.

2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Explore how data is stored and manipulated in programming.
   - Understand different data types and how to use variables to represent data in your code.

3. **Basic Operators**
   - Dive into the operators used for performing arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
   - Learn how these operators are used to manipulate data and implement logic in your programs.

4. **Input and Output Operations**
   - Master the ways in which a program interacts with the user and the system.
   - Learn how to accept input from the user, process it, and display output.
