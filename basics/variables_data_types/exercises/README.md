### Practical Python Examples

**Task 1: Create a Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Then, print the result.**

```python
# Python Program to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

# Assign values to width and height variables
width = 10
height = 5

# Calculate area
area = width * height

# Print the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)

# Answer Key:
# The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

**Task 2: Write a Python program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.**

```python
# Python Program to Convert Temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius

# Get temperature in Fahrenheit from user
fahrenheit = float(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))

# Calculate Celsius
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

# Print the result
print(fahrenheit, "Fahrenheit is equal to", celsius, "degrees Celsius.")

# Example Answer Key (assuming the user enters 68 Fahrenheit):
# 68.0 Fahrenheit is equal to 20.0 degrees Celsius.
```

The matching and multiple choice questions test the students' understanding of basic concepts, while the practical Python examples encourage them to apply what they have learned in a real-world context. The answer keys provide immediate feedback for self-assessment.
